# Comments

To write a single line comment use `//`.

```js
// Single line comment
```

To write multiline comments, use the `/* ... */` syntax commonly found in other languages.

Do not add a `*` to the front of a line, it will make its way into the compiled Shortcut.

```js
/*
This is a multiline comment
*/

/*
Line 1
Line 2
*/
```

Any comments of either type are translated over into the compiled Shortcut as comment actions.
