# Comments

To write a single-line comment use `//`.

```
// Single-line comment
```

To write multiline comments, use `/* ... */`.

Do not add a `*` to the front of a line, it will make its way into the compiled Shortcut.

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment
*/

/*
Line 1
Line 2
*/
```

Any comments of either type are translated over into the compiled Shortcut as comment actions.
