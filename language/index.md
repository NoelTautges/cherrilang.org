# Getting Started

Welcome to the Cherri programming language documentation!

Thanks for taking an interest in the Cherri programming language. Don't worry! Cherri is designed to be easy to learn and use, it's likely very similar to a programming language you are already familiar with.

Contributing to this open-source documentation is more than welcome as this language is in the early stages and while most
things work, bugs, or inaccurate documentation are very likely.
